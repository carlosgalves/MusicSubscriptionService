# US 05 - Update a plan

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description
As marketing director, I want to change a plan’s details other than pricing

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the client clarifications:**
> **Question:**
> In US5 I would like to know if the customer can also change the status of the plan, that is, for a deactivated plan, as in US4. By the way, I would also like to know if a plan that was deactivated can be activated again.
> 
> **Answer:**
> US4 and US5 are two different user stories. US4 deactivating a plan only deactivates the plan. US5 change plan features except price. It does not change whether the plan is active or not. A deactivated plan will in the future be terminated "ceased" but it is not possible to be active again

> **Question:**
> Could indicate what are the acceptance criteria for the US 5?
> 
>  **Answer:**
> The marketing director can update any of the plan's attributes except its name and price.
