> * Image is optional and can be of any standard image format (jpg, png, ...).

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* MAC address is mandatory and should be a valid MAC address.
* Designation is mandatory and should be alphanumeric with a maximum of 50 characters.
* Image is optional and can be of any standard image format (jpg, png, ...).
* Analysis and design documentation
* OpenAPI specification
* POSTMAN collection with sample requests for all the use cases with tests
* Proper handling of concurrent access
* Only users with "subscriber" role may create new devices

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

* Devices are identified by their MAC Address only. 
* The associated subscriptions' currentDevices value should be incremented when adding a new device.
* Subscriptions are accessed via the userId read from the AUthToken.

## 2. Design - User Story Realization 

### 2.1. Rationale

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Device
 * Subscription

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * DeviceController  
 * DeviceMapper
 * DeviceDTO
 * DeviceService
 * SubscriptionRepository
 * DeviceRepository
