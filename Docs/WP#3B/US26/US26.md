### 1.6 Other Relevant Remarks

The table presented as the outputted data can be represented as a json document such as in the following example:
``` json
{
  "data": {
    "columns": ["Plan", "Metric", Total],
    "rows": [
        {
            "plan": "Free",
            "metric": {
                "activeSubscriptions": 10,
                "newSubscriptions": 8,
                "cancelledSubscriptions": 4,
                "churnRate": 50.0,
                "revenue": 180.87
            } 
        },
        {
            ...
        },
        {
            "plan": "TOTAL",
            "metric": {
                "activeSubscriptions": 36,
                "newSubscriptions": 24,
                "cancelledSubscriptions": 7,
                "churnRate": 25.0,
                "revenue": 574.13
            }
        }
    ]
  }
}
```

***

The churn rate represents the ratio between new and cancelled subscriptions and is calculated like this:
```
churnRate =  cancelledSubscriptions / activeSubscriptions * 100
```
***

* When calculating new subscriptions, cancellations and the revenue only subscription from the current year should be considered.

***
If no filter is present all plans should be returned. Otherwise, only consider the plan that matches the filter. 


## 2. Design - User Story Realization
