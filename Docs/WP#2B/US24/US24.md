# US 24 - To migrate all subscribers of a certain plan to a different plan

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As marketing director, I want to migrate all subscribers of a certain plan to a different plan

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** us 24- When a user upgrades/downgrades his plan, does his new plan take effect immediately, or only when his current subscription ends? 
>               With immediate effect, your previous subscription is canceled.
>
> **Answer:** Takes effect immediately.
> 
> **Question:** US 22 and 24 - when the customer's plan is changed, do we have to delete the previously associated devices, being necessary to introduce them again or should we migrate them to the new subscription? 
>               Since if the plan reduces the maximum number of devices, it may not be possible to keep all those that were already associated with the subscription.
>               If we don't delete the devices from the subscription, how do we choose which ones should remain in case there is a reduction in the maximum number of devices?
> 
> **Answer:** If the new plan does not allow keeping the same number of devices that the customer currently has, it should not be possible to change the plan. 
>             The customer must first remove some of his devices and then change plans
