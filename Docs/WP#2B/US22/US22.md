# US 22 - Switch plan

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As subscriber, I want to switch my plan (upgrade/downgrade)

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** I would like to know the criteria for distinguishing between upgrade and downgrade at the time of the US22 regarding the change of plan by the user.
>
> **Answer:** The customer can choose a plan different from their current one. the downgrade or upgrade will have to do with your intention and which plan you chose in relation to your current one. from a functional point of view there is no difference.
>
> **Question:** US 22 and 24 - when the customer's plan is changed, do we have to delete the previously associated devices, being necessary to introduce them again or should we migrate them to the new subscription?
>               Since if the plan reduces the maximum number of devices, it may not be possible to keep all those that were already associated with the subscription.
>               If we don't delete the devices from the subscription, how do we choose which ones should remain in case there is a reduction in the maximum number of devices?
>
> **Answer:** If the new plan does not allow keeping the same number of devices that the customer currently has, it should not be possible to change the plan.
>             The customer must first remove some of his devices and then change plans

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* Analysis and design documentation
* OpenAPI specification
* POSTMAN collection with sample requests for all the use cases with tests
* Proper handling of concurrent access

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* D022-01: For a client to be able to switch plans he must have a subscription.
* D022-02: For a client to be able to switch plans, the plan he wishes to switch to must exist and not be the same as the one he is already subscribed to.
