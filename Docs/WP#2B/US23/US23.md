# US 24 - Renew annual Subscription

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As subscriber, I want to renew my annual subscription

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the client clarifications:**

>  **Question:** When a subscription is made, depending on the type of payment, can I calculate a subscription end date or is this only defined when the user cancels the subscription, assuming that he will always renew until he cancels his subscription?
>                Taking into account that US23 - "As subscriber I want to renew my annual subscription" is the only one that renews subscriptions, assuming that I set the subscription end date at the time of subscription, is there no way to renew monthly subscriptions? or do i assume monthly subscriptions are always renewed and just set an end date at the time the subscriber cancels?
>
> **Answer:** monthly subscriptions are assumed to be renewable every month.
>             In the case of annual subscriptions, it is assumed that they will have an end date of 12 months after subscription/renewal.
